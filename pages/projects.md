Timely, formative feedback is essential in academia, helping students reinforce learning and develop the skills needed for subsequent assignments and advanced topics. However, manually assessing code submissions is time-consuming and often delays feedback. This project investigates state-of-the-art automated code assessment techniques and proposes CodeInspector—a CI-driven automated solution that leverages industry-standard tools, enabling students to submit their code for assessment and receive immediate feedback on quality and correctness while supporting iterative learning and continuous improvement.

### AI-Driven Static Analysis and Feedback Generation

A common challenge among novice programmers is interpreting runtime error stack traces and manually detecting logic and style errors in their Java code, often leading to inefficient debugging and poor coding practices. This study aims to design an AI-driven static analysis and feedback-generation approach that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning clustering techniques to statically identify code errors.

Local Memory Store (LMStore) is a novel scratchpad memory (SPM) design, featuring some hardware management of the SPM along with explicit access and interaction by the program. Rather than presenting the program with a flat, directly accessed address space, LMStore uses indirect references in the form of 2-tuples and 3-tuples to access data stored in its memory, allowing LMStore to manage its memory more effectively for better utilization. This project explores data management schemes specifically designed to maximize LMStore performance, with a focus on reducing power consumption and minimizing memory access latency in embedded programs.
