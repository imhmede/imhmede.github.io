### About

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Eastern New Mexico University. I earned my Ph.D. in 2022 and M.S. in 2020 from New Mexico State University. I lead the Software Engineering and Performance Optimization (SEPO) Lab, where we explore Agile-based pedagogical approaches and develop tools that support programming instruction and promote effective software engineering practices in the classroom.
